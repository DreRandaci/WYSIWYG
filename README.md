# WYSIWYG
- [x] Create an array of objects that represents famous people (see structure below).
- [x] Create a text input in your DOM.
- [x] Beneath that, create a container, block element in your DOM.
- [x] Create a DOM element for each of the objects inside the container. Style your person elements however you like.
- [x] For every even numbered element, have a light yellow background.
- [x] For every odd numbered element, have a light blue background.
### Each element's DOM structure should be as shown below
- [x] When you click on one of the person elements, a dotted border should appear around it.
- [x] When you click on one of the person elements, the text input should immediately gain focus so that you can start typing.
- [x] When there is a highlighted person element, and you begin typing in the input box, the person's biography should be immediately bound to what you are typing, letter by letter.
- [x] When you press the enter/return key when typing in the input field, then the content of the input field should immediately be blank.
